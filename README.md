# Store-Simulator
Hunter Inc is a company that carries exactly 20 model of shirts.
These shirts are sold in its retail stores throughout the nation.
Each of the company's retail store must carry between 5 and 20 of those models. 
A shirt sells for exactly 5 dollars.
A store can only sell items that it carries and cannot sell beyond the quantity it currently has in stock.
The company itself cannot distribute to its retail stores more shirts than it currently has.
In short,there is no back order. Furthermore, if a retail store requests a quantity (in a particular model) than the company currently has,
Hunter Inc will just deliver what it has at hand to complete the order.
